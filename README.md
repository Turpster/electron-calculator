# Electron Calculator

I thought this was going to be difficult to learn Electron, but this project was much easier than expected. It's fun to code and see Javascript being used in such a productive way.

it is also around 50MB for some platforms, so if your out of your mind, you sure can use my app! ðŸ˜†
